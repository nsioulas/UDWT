# UDWT
This file decomposes the vector magnetic field fluctuations onto the vector background magnetic field using the undecimated discrete wavelet decomposition. The scale-by-scale 'details' and 'approximations' provide the scale-by-scale fluctuations and background field, respectively. This type of anisotropy study is historically called 'variance anisotropy'. This is basically the anisotropy study of magnetic field quantities rather than the wavevector 'k_i' values that it depends upon.
